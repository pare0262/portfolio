# Esmeralda Paredes' Portfolio

## Project Description
Explore my latest web portfolio developed during the Advanced CSS and Bootstrap module in the Web Dev II course. Inspired by our UX study on audience behavior and client analysis, this design is tailored to effectively engage and cater to the specific needs and services we aim to provide.

## Challenges
This was difficult. For me honestly everything was challenging, even learning this things I am still struggling depply with it, I hope that with more practice I get better and better, but from using bootstrap to organize everything and make it looks like the UX assignment.

## Lessons Learned
I learned Bootstrap, a more advance CSS stuff, things about images and many stuff that make developing a lot easier. I hope I can get better at it.

## Frameworks and Libraries
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
